# Crop_Recommendation_System

## Description

A crop recommendation system using machine learning can be incredibly beneficial for farmers and the agricultural industry.By selecting the right crops based on data-driven insights, farmers can maximize their yield and reduce the risk of crop failure.Promoting sustainable farming practices by recommending crops that are well-suited to the local environment.

This system takes several factors such as Soil Minerals, Rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels to determine the most suitable crops for a given region.By analyzing historical data and using predictive models, this system recommends specific conditions of a farm or agricultural area to grow a specific type of crop.

## How Model was Trained

The dataset used in this project has been meticulously preprocessed to ensure high-quality inputs for the machine learning models. This preprocessing step involved handling null values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data to ensure consistency and accuracy.To build robust predictive models, we employed various machine learning algorithms, including:Decision Trees,Random Forests,Support Vector Machines (SVM),Gradient Boosting Techniques.The best-performing model was selected based on its ability to provide reliable and actionable crop recommendations.

## How Website is design

This website is dedicated to transforming agriculture by offering an innovative suite of tools and services. Farmers can access insights on crops in demand, make informed decisions using our advanced crop prediction technology based on soil features, and even lease farm equipment conveniently. It provide expert Crop Advisory Services, ensuring tailored guidance for improved yields, and connect farmers to markets for seamless access to buyers. Additionally, our Workshops and Training Programs equip farmers with practical skills and cutting-edge knowledge to thrive in the ever-evolving agricultural landscape. With this website, farmers can grow, innovate, and build a sustainable future.

## How Backend is integrated

I integrated machine learning capabilities by employing the pickle module, which allows us to serialize and deserialize pre-trained models for efficient predictions. The Flask backend as the web framework is used to seamlessly handle user requests and process data, ensuring a robust backend infrastructure.
## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the agricultural research community, farmers, and organizations for providing valuable insights, data, and domain knowledge that contributed to the development of this Crop Recommendation System. We welcome contributions to improve the crop recommendation system. Please feel free to submit issues, create pull requests, or suggest enhancements.
